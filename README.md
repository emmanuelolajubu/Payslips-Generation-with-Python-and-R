# Payslips-Generation-with-Python-and-R
This project highlights how to dynamically generate names and payslips for workers in an organization. The project was made with Python and converted to R.
I used the Faker library and Random module to generate names and payslips in the Python framework and specified the condition statements. The code was eventually converted to R.
